Assignment 6 – Simple App Using a Public API

Overview

This project fulfills the requirements of Assignment 6: Your Own Simple App, where we build a simple, semantic, user-friendly webpage that consumes and displays data from a real public REST API using fetch().

The application retrieves live data from the chosen API and displays it clearly on the page.
No static data is used — all content is requested in real time.
